### Hotel Booking Analysis
This project focuses on the analysis of a dataset containing hotel bookings information. The dataset includes a range of features providing detailed insights into the booking habits, customer characteristics, and the nature of bookings.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of 119,390 rows (bookings) and 32 columns (features), including:

Type of hotel (Resort Hotel, City Hotel)
Whether the booking was canceled
Lead time
Arrival date (year, month, day)
Number of adults, children, and babies
Country of origin
Market segment and distribution channel
Repeated guest status
Previous cancellations and bookings
Deposit type
Days in the waiting list
Customer type
Average daily rate (ADR)

### Methodology
The project utilizes Python for data analysis, with libraries such as pandas, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy. The analysis begins with data cleaning, where irrelevant columns are dropped and missing values are handled. The cleaned data is then used for exploratory data analysis, where various features are visualized and examined to draw insights.
